# Using-Hybrid-methods-to-improve-the-performance-of-Model
Generally, There are several Hybrid methods (Tsai & Chen, 2010):
- Classification + Clustering
- Classification + Classification
- Clustering + Classification
- Clustering + Clustering


The use of hybrid methods increases the performance of the model

This code is showing Hybrid methods in **Pima Diabetes Dataset** to improve the performance of Models. The steps in this code are as follows: 

- To fill missing data: KNN has been used (**Classification**)
- To remove outliers: K-means has been used (**Clustering**)
- Finally, SVM, Na√Øve Bayes and C4.5 have been used to train the Models (**Classification**).
